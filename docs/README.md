## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
src/features/
├── sleep-logging/    # 5 components, 3,567 lines total
├── messaging/        # Real-time chat
├── shared/          # Reusable utilities
└── index.ts         # Clean barrel exports
```

## 🚀 Key Improvements

- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Reusability:** Standalone, focused components  
- **Developer Experience:** Clean imports with barrel exports
- **Performance:** Optimized Firebase listeners and state management
- **Scalability:** Feature-based organization ready for team development

## 🔧 Quick Start

1. **Finding components:** Use the [Component Map](./component-map.md)
2. **Adding features:** Follow the [Developer Guide](./developer-guide.md)
3. **Clean imports:** Use `import { Component } from "@/features"`
