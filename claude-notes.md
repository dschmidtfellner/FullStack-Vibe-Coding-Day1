## Current Session: Sleep Log "Night Before" Investigation

### Task
Search for and understand the implementation of the "night before" bedtime display in sleep logs.

### Findings

1. **Component Structure**:
   - `SleepLogTile` component (src/components/SleepLogTile.tsx) handles the display
   - Has an `isNightBefore` prop that controls whether to show "Night before—[time]" subtitle
   - When `isNightBefore` is true:
     - Shows "Night before—[nightBeforeEndTime]" instead of time range
     - Tile is rendered with 50% opacity
     - Still shows "Bedtime" as the log type

2. **Date Logic Location**:
   - In `src/routes/index.tsx`, the `LogsListView` component
   - Function `getLogsForSelectedDate()` (lines 874-892) handles the filtering
   - Key logic:
     ```typescript
     // Get previous day's bedtime (if any)
     const previousDate = new Date(selectedDate + 'T12:00:00');
     previousDate.setDate(previousDate.getDate() - 1);
     const previousDateKey = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-CA').format(previousDate);
     
     const previousDayBedtime = state.logs.find(log => {
       const logDateKey = log.localDate || getLocalDateKey(log.timestamp);
       return logDateKey === previousDateKey && log.sleepType === 'bedtime';
     });
     ```

3. **How It Works**:
   - Each SleepLog has a `localDate` field (YYYY-MM-DD format in child's timezone)
   - When viewing a specific date, the system:
     - Filters logs for the selected date
     - Calculates the previous date
     - Searches for a bedtime log from the previous date
     - If found, displays it at the top with "Night before" styling

4. **Display Logic** (lines 1111-1132):
   - Previous day bedtime is rendered separately before current day's logs
   - Wrapped in a div with `opacity: 0.5`
   - Passes `isNightBefore={true}` to SleepLogTile
   - Calculates the end time from the last event in the log

### Key Files
- `/Users/davidschmidt-fellner/FullStack-Vibe-Coding-Day1/src/components/SleepLogTile.tsx` - Component that renders the tile
- `/Users/davidschmidt-fellner/FullStack-Vibe-Coding-Day1/src/routes/index.tsx` - Contains date filtering logic in LogsListView
- `/Users/davidschmidt-fellner/FullStack-Vibe-Coding-Day1/src/lib/firebase-messaging.ts` - Defines SleepLog type with localDate field

### Status
Investigation complete. The "night before" logic is implemented by finding bedtime logs from the previous day and displaying them with special styling at the top of the current day's log list.
