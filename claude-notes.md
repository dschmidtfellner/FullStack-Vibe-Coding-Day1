## Important Context
- Full-stack TypeScript app with React + Vite + TanStack Router (frontend)
- TRANSITIONING: From Convex backend to Firebase for messaging performance
- Firebase project: doulaconnect-messaging
- Target: High-performance messaging module for integration with Bubble app
- Use `mcp__shell-commands__launch-dev-all` to start development servers
- Project follows git workflow with frequent commits as checkpoints
