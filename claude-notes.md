# Claude Code Session Notes

## Session Start
- Starting commit hash: d9229dd (fix: Remove unused functions and imports causing TypeScript build errors)
- Session commits: [cleanup commit, a58681b (sleep statistics implementation)]

## Current Status - CONVEX CLEANUP COMPLETE ✅
- **COMPLETED: Convex completely removed from project**
- Firebase project "doulaconnect-messaging" created and configured
- Firestore database with security rules deployed
- Complete migration from Convex to Firebase accomplished
- Real-time messaging working with Firebase listeners
- Image and audio uploads using Firebase Storage
- All messaging features preserved (text, image, audio)
- **COMPLETED: Firebase Cloud Functions API implemented for Bubble integration**
- **READY: Test page created to demonstrate API functionality**

## Firebase Migration Progress
- ✅ Firebase CLI installed and authenticated
- ✅ Firebase project "doulaconnect-messaging" created
- ✅ Firestore database created with production mode
- ✅ Security rules deployed for messaging collections
- ✅ Firebase SDK installed and configured
- ✅ Environment variables set up for Firebase connection
- ✅ Firebase-Clerk authentication integration working
- ✅ Real-time messaging utilities created and implemented
- ✅ Convex dependencies completely removed
- ✅ UI components updated to use Firebase data structure
- ✅ Firebase Storage integration for file uploads
- ✅ Real-time listeners working for instant message updates

## App Status
- Messaging app successfully migrated to Firebase
- All features working: text messages, image uploads, audio recording
- Real-time updates faster than previous Convex implementation
- **COMPLETED: Clean audio recording implementation** ✅ - separate mic button works perfectly without layout shifts
- **COMPLETED: Real-time typing indicators** ✅ - shows when other users are typing with animated dots and smart debouncing
- **COMPLETED: Message reactions** ✅ - emoji reactions with picker, real-time updates, and user tracking
- **COMPLETED: Conversation-based messaging** ✅ - child-specific conversations with URL routing
- **COMPLETED: JWT authentication system** ✅ - replaced Clerk with Bubble-compatible JWT tokens
- **COMPLETED: Sleep statistics calculations** ✅ - comprehensive sleep analytics for Sleep Consulting children with 5 key metrics
- Ready for integration as module in Bubble app

## Important Context
- Full-stack TypeScript app with React + Vite + TanStack Router (frontend)
- TRANSITIONING: From Convex backend to Firebase for messaging performance
- Firebase project: doulaconnect-messaging
- Target: High-performance messaging module for integration with Bubble app
- Use `mcp__shell-commands__launch-dev-all` to start development servers
- Project follows git workflow with frequent commits as checkpoints

## Time Validation Implementation for Sleep Logs

### Feature: Time Input Validation Guardrails

### What was implemented:

1. **Overnight Logic (Prepped Time)**
   - Created `createEventTimestamp` function that adds 24 hours if the inputted time is before the most recent event
   - This handles overnight sleep sessions automatically

2. **Validation Rules:**
   - **Valid (No Warning)**: 0-12 hours after last event
   - **Warning (Confirmable)**: 12-16 hours after last event
     - Shows yellow warning with "Confirm" button
     - Message: "That time is more than 12 hours after the last logged time - are you sure you want to save it?"
     - Subtext: "Did you instead want to end this [Nap/Bedtime] and start another?"
   - **Error (Hard Block)**: 16+ hours after last event
     - Shows red error, no way to proceed
     - Message: "Unable to add a log more than 16 hours after your last logged time in this [Nap/Bedtime]."
     - Subtext: "Consider adding a new [Nap/Bedtime] instead."

3. **Future Time Validation:**
   - Warns if time is more than 5 minutes in the future
   - Applies to both initial timestamp and subsequent events
   - Shows yellow warning with "Confirm" button

4. **Button Rate Limiting:**
   - Add button disabled for 1.5 seconds after being pressed
   - Prevents accidental duplicate entries from button mashing

5. **UI Updates:**
   - Added validation warning display above action buttons
   - Shows contextual buttons: "Confirm" for warnings, "Change Time" when there's an error
   - Color-coded warnings: Yellow for confirmable warnings, Red for hard blocks
   - Validation runs on both time picker and date picker changes

### Implementation Details:
- Added validation state variables: `validationWarning`, `isButtonDisabled`, `lastButtonPressTime`
- Created `validateTimeInput` function that checks all validation rules
- Updated `handleSave` to include validation checks and rate limiting
- Modified UI to display warnings and handle confirmation flow

### Commits Made:
- `feat: Add time validation guardrails for sleep log inputs`

### Next Steps:
- The validation system is fully implemented and ready for testing
- All validation scenarios should be tested with real user input
- Consider adding analytics to track how often validations are triggered
