## Time Validation Implementation for Sleep Logs

### Feature: Time Input Validation Guardrails

### What was implemented:

1. **Overnight Logic (Prepped Time)**
   - Created `createEventTimestamp` function that adds 24 hours if the inputted time is before the most recent event
   - This handles overnight sleep sessions automatically

2. **Validation Rules:**
   - **Valid (No Warning)**: 0-12 hours after last event
   - **Warning (Confirmable)**: 12-16 hours after last event
     - Shows yellow warning with "Confirm" button
     - Message: "That time is more than 12 hours after the last logged time - are you sure you want to save it?"
     - Subtext: "Did you instead want to end this [Nap/Bedtime] and start another?"
   - **Error (Hard Block)**: 16+ hours after last event
     - Shows red error, no way to proceed
     - Message: "Unable to add a log more than 16 hours after your last logged time in this [Nap/Bedtime]."
     - Subtext: "Consider adding a new [Nap/Bedtime] instead."

3. **Future Time Validation:**
   - Warns if time is more than 5 minutes in the future
   - Applies to both initial timestamp and subsequent events
   - Shows yellow warning with "Confirm" button

4. **Button Rate Limiting:**
   - Add button disabled for 1.5 seconds after being pressed
   - Prevents accidental duplicate entries from button mashing

5. **UI Updates:**
   - Added validation warning display above action buttons
   - Shows contextual buttons: "Confirm" for warnings, "Change Time" when there's an error
   - Color-coded warnings: Yellow for confirmable warnings, Red for hard blocks
   - Validation runs on both time picker and date picker changes

### Implementation Details:
- Added validation state variables: `validationWarning`, `isButtonDisabled`, `lastButtonPressTime`
- Created `validateTimeInput` function that checks all validation rules
- Updated `handleSave` to include validation checks and rate limiting
- Modified UI to display warnings and handle confirmation flow

### Commits Made:
- `feat: Add time validation guardrails for sleep log inputs`
- `fix: Complete modal relative date text implementation`

### Recently Completed:
- ✅ Implemented relative date text in sleep log modal
- ✅ Modal now shows "Yesterday", "2 days ago", etc. instead of just "Today"
- ✅ Matches the relative date functionality in the log list view
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded "Today" check with dynamic `getModalRelativeDateText()` function

### Next Steps:
- The validation system is fully implemented and ready for testing
- All validation scenarios should be tested with real user input
- Consider adding analytics to track how often validations are triggered

## Edit Interface for Sleep Logs

### Objective
Implement an Edit interface for the Log Detail page that allows users to:
- Edit times of existing sleep events
- Delete sleep events
- Add interjections between events
- Move the entire log to a different date

### Progress Status
✅ Added Edit button next to Delete button on Log Detail page
✅ Created new edit-log route and view
✅ Implemented EditLogView component with:
  - Header with Cancel/Save buttons
  - Preserved log tile from detail view with delete icon
  - Date selector to move entire log
  - Event list with Edit/Delete functionality
  - Inline time editing with TimePicker
  - Plus buttons between events for interjections
  - Smart interjection type detection
✅ Styled interface to match the provided screenshot:
  - Clean layout with horizontal dividers
  - Purple/pink themed buttons and icons
  - Proper spacing and alignment
  - Subtle gray delete icons

### Modal to Full-Screen Page Transformation
✅ Converted EditLogModal from modal overlay to full-screen page
✅ Removed backdrop and modal constraints 
✅ Fixed scrolling issues by removing fixed positioning
✅ Updated navigation to go back to LogDetailView instead of LogsListView
✅ Hidden comment input bar when EditLogModal is visible
✅ Added validation for consecutive same event types with red formatting and exclamation marks
✅ Implemented validation dialog to prevent saving with consecutive same types

### Commits Made During Session
1. "feat: Add Edit interface for sleep logs with date selector, inline time editing, and interjection support"
2. "fix: Polish Edit interface styling to match design specifications"
3. "fix: Restructure EditLogView as modal overlay to show LogDetailView background"
4. Multiple fixes for modal behavior, scrolling, and validation

### Important Implementation Details
- Created new 'edit-log' view type in NavigationState
- Modified navigateToEditLog to use 'edit-log' instead of 'log-sleep'
- Events are converted from Firestore Timestamp format to Date for editing
- Date changes move all events by the same time offset
- Interjections are placed halfway between existing events
- Save function updates Firebase and navigates back to log detail
- Validation prevents saving consecutive same event types (e.g., two "Awake" events in a row)

## Wake-Windows View Implementation

### Objective
Create an alternative view mode in the Log List that shows wake/sleep periods chronologically with duration calculations between events.

### Progress Status
✅ Added toggle button in upper right of Log List (Events/Windows)
✅ Created Windows view showing chronological timeline of sleep periods
✅ Implemented duration calculation between consecutive subevents
✅ Styled tiles with proper colors:
  - Pink (#F0DDEF) for awake in bed periods (Put in bed/Woke up events)
  - Purple (#745288) with white text for asleep periods (Fell asleep events)
  - Gray for out of bed periods
✅ Added gray line separators before/after out of bed tiles
✅ Made tiles clickable to open associated sleep log
✅ Fixed timestamp alignment to top of tiles
✅ Set timestamp color to light purple (#745288)
✅ Implemented correct event filtering logic:
  - Shows events from logs that started on selected day
  - PLUS previous day bedtime's "out of bed" event only
  - This creates proper bridge showing timespan from previous night to current day

### Commits Made During Session
1. "feat: Add Windows view toggle to show wake/sleep periods chronologically"
2. "fix: Polish Windows view with correct colors, alignment, and event filtering logic"
3. "fix: Remove padding from timestamp to align with top of tiles"

### Technical Implementation
- Added `viewMode` state with 'events' | 'windows' toggle
- Created `getWindowsViewData()` function to process chronological events
- Implemented `formatDuration()` helper for "Xh Ym" format
- Events sorted chronologically across all relevant logs
- Duration calculated between consecutive events
- Smart filtering to show only relevant events per day

### Visual Design
- Toggle button styled consistently with app design
- Timestamps in light purple (#745288) aligned with tile tops
- Color-coded tiles for different sleep states
- Gray separators visually distinguish out-of-bed periods
- Maintains clickability to navigate to source logs

### Next Steps
- Feature complete and ready for user testing
- Consider adding additional analytics or insights to Windows view
- Monitor user feedback for potential refinements

## Date and Time Input Styling Enhancements

### Objective
Improve the visual appearance and usability of date and time input fields throughout the application.

### Progress Status
✅ Enhanced font sizes for better readability:
  - Date inputs: `text-base` → `text-xl` (20px)
  - Time picker inputs: `1rem` → `1.25rem` (20px)
✅ Added consistent width styling to all TimePicker components (`w-32`)
✅ Fixed date input calendar icon visibility with `colorScheme` property
✅ Resolved date input width issues - increased to `w-44` to prevent text overlap with calendar icon
✅ Restructured header layout for better UX:
  - Date navigation controls (arrows + date) left-aligned as a group
  - Windows/Events toggle moved to right side of same row
✅ Left-aligned date picker dropdown for improved alignment

### Commits Made During Session
1. "feat: Enhance date and time input styling with larger fonts and improved layout"

### Technical Implementation
- Updated all TimePicker instances with `w-32` width class
- Modified CSS font sizes in `src/index.css` for TimePicker components
- Enhanced date input styling with proper width and color scheme
- Restructured header layout using flexbox justify-between
- Improved date picker alignment from center to left

### Visual Improvements
- Larger, more readable fonts for date and time inputs
- Consistent sizing across all time picker components
- Better calendar icon visibility in both light and dark modes
- Cleaner header layout with logical grouping of controls
- Fixed input field width issues preventing text overlap
